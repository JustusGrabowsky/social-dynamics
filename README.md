# Romantic Dynamics

## An Investigation into Emotional Instability

This is a scientific exploration of a model for the **Dynamics of Love Affairs**. We use systems of differential equations to predict how two individuals' feelings for each other evolve over time. In reality romantic stability is determined by emotional growth and good communcation, here it is governed by the eigenvalues of the system matrix.

Inspired by Strogatz' *Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos*, Chapter 5.3, we address pressing questions, like:
* Can two eager beavers avoid infinite emotional escalation?
* Do certain romantic styles guarantee a descent into a stable node of mutual apathy?

We try to vizualize the results in an insightful and entertainig way.
