# Social Dynamics

Modeling relationship dynamics using nonlinear systems. Two coupled ODEs determine how affinity between people evolves—will they converge in love, spiral into chaos, or stay stuck?

**23 scenarios** ranging from "The Chase" to "Codependency," each with unique mathematical signatures (spirals, saddles, nodes, centers).

## Features

- 📊 **Phase portraits** showing all possible trajectories
- 📈 **Time series analysis** of affinity over time  
- 🎬 **Animated simulations** visualizing dynamics in real time
- 🔍 **Eigenvalue classification** revealing mathematical structure

## Quick Start

Open `social_dynamics_improved.ipynb` and run all cells. Generates visualizations and 5 animated GIFs.

**Based on:** Strogatz, *Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos* (Ch. 5.3)
